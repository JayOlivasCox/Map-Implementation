This for-class project is a program that implements a map using a hash table. I used hash tables because the max capacity was low (I was told it'd be around 25 objects).
 Since it'd only be around 25 objects, I used an array that has a size of 5, to make the searching, adding, deleting, etc. functions be O(1).
